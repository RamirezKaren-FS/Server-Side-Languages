# Module 2

configured the second module with working error codes. could not figure out why the first route was not working but when no information was prompted for the adding of a movie the correct errors showed. 

Will start work on making my second model and adding the information for the second model on video through postman. 

Was stuck on the error messaage but could not figure out how to properly link the correct error... was only able to show a custom message if it was placed in the call itself which is not what I believe you want

Have successfully made a model and linked it through the route

removed the files for 1.7

going off of module 1 using the server files to make the needed changes for module two
